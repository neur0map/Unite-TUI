## Deployment

DailyHub is built with Nuxt, so you can use any of the Nuxt deployment methods. We recommend using the `generate` command to build the application for production. It will generate the static HTML files and serve them.

This way you can easily deploy the application to any static site hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, etc.

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run generate

# pnpm
pnpm run generate

# yarn
yarn generate

# bun
bun run generate
```

Files will be generated in the `.output/public/` directory. You can then upload the files to your hosting service.

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```

You can find more information about the deployment in the [Nuxt Deployment](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) documentation.
